- Hi, I’m @Lance-Handkammer I am starting to learn python on 9/27/22 in my free time because I want to be able to make cool things like Michael Reevs.
- I’m interested in FRC Robotics and any basic arduino or rasberry pie projects.
- I’m currently learning Python but am open to your suggestions about the most versatile codeing laguage.
- I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything. Just ask me and I'll probably say yes.
- My phone number is (704-603-7325) and my email is Lancerjh@gmail.com
